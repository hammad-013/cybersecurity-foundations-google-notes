As of 2022, CISSP defined 8 domains to organize work of security professionals.
1. Security and Risk Management

	- Risk Mitigation - process of having the right procedure and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach.
	- Business Continuity - organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.
2. Asset Security
	- secures digital and physical assets, also related to storage, maintenance, retention and destruction of data. e.g. destroying old unused equipment
3. Security Architecture and Engineering
	- optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, system and processes in place to protect organization's asset and data. e.g. configuring firewall
	- Shared Responsibility - all individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security.
4. Communication and Network Security
	- manage and secure physical networks and wireless communication. e.g. analyze user behavior (connected to unsecured hotspots)
5. Identity and Access Management
	- keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications. e.g. setting up key cards to access building
	- 4 Components - identification, authentication, authorization, accountability
6. Security Assessment and Testing
	 - conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats and vulnerabilities. e.g. access to payroll information auditing
7. Security Operations
	- conducting investigations (when, why and how) and implementing preventive measures after an incident has occurred. e.g. receive alert unidentified device, stop the threat
8. Software Development Security
	- uses secure coding practices, which are st of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services. e.g. collaborations between software engineer and security analyst
Security Posture
   - An organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data, and react to change.
