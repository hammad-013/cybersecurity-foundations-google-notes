### **Definition:**

A **security audit** is a **systematic evaluation** of an organization's information systems to assess how well security policies, procedures, and controls are working.

### **Who performs it?**

- Usually performed by **external or third-party** security professionals or auditors.
- Examples: Independent firms, security consultants, regulatory bodies.

### **Purpose:**

- To verify compliance with security standards (like ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA).
- To identify vulnerabilities and ensure controls are working.
- To give an **unbiased report** on security posture.

### **Scope:**

- Can cover networks, applications, physical security, cloud setups, etc.
- Focuses on **external compliance** and **risk exposure**.

### **Examples:**

- An external team audits a bank to ensure it meets **PCI-DSS** standards for handling credit card data.
- A healthcare provider undergoes a **HIPAA audit** to verify patient data is securely stored and accessed.

## 1. Internal   2. External
## **Internal Security Audit**

### **Definition:**

An **internal security audit** is performed **by the organization’s own internal security or audit team** to review and strengthen internal processes and controls.

## 1. **Scope and Goal**

### **Scope:**

Defines **what areas will be audited**. It sets **boundaries** to avoid scope creep and helps focus on critical assets or functions.

- **Includes:**
    
    - Systems (e.g., database servers, endpoints)
    - Departments (e.g., HR, Finance)
    - Policies (e.g., access control, incident response)
    - Time frame (e.g., Q2 2025 audit)

_Example:_  
"Audit all Linux servers in the production environment to evaluate compliance with the company’s patch management policy."

### **Goal:**

Defines **why** the audit is being conducted — the **purpose or objective**.

- Improve security posture
- Detect vulnerabilities
- Validate internal controls
- Prepare for external audits
- Ensure data protection and regulatory compliance    

_Example:_  
"Ensure that access control practices adhere to the principle of least privilege."

## 2. **Risk Assessment**

### **What it is:**

Identifies and evaluates **potential threats** to systems, data, or operations.

- **Steps include:**
    - Identify assets (e.g., employee data, critical systems)
    - Identify threats (e.g., malware, insider threat, data leakage)
    - Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated software, open ports)
    - Analyze the **impact** and **likelihood** of risks        

_Example:_  
The audit team identifies that the HR system still uses default credentials — **high risk** due to sensitive employee data.

---

## 3. **Controls Assessment**

### **What it is:**

Evaluate the **effectiveness of existing security controls** — both technical and administrative.

- Access controls
- Network security
- Encryption practices
- Authentication mechanisms
- Backup and recovery controls

 _Example:_  
Checking if firewalls are configured to block unused ports, or if employees are using 2FA for email access.

- You’re assessing **whether the controls exist**, are **properly implemented**, and are **functioning as intended**.    

---

## 4. **Assessing Compliance**

### **What it is:**

Compare internal practices against **relevant standards**, laws, and policies.

- **Internal:** Company security policies, code of conduct
- **External:** ISO 27001, NIST, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.

_Example:_  
Checking whether financial systems follow **PCI-DSS** standards for storing credit card data.

- Also involves **checking if employees follow internal procedures**, like reporting suspicious emails or locking workstations.    

---

## 5. **Communicating Results**

### **What it is:**

Presenting audit findings to **stakeholders** (management, IT teams, compliance officers) in a clear and actionable way.

- **Report includes:**
    - Summary of findings
    - Risk levels (High, Medium, Low)
    - Root cause analysis
    - Recommendations
    - Deadlines for remediation
    - Responsible parties

_Example:_  
"Three servers were found to be missing critical patches. Recommend automated patch management and monthly patch audits. Deadline: 15 Sept 2025."

- Follow-up meetings may be scheduled for **remediation tracking**.
